psychopy/exptools2 code to create Gaborpatches in visual noise

# Eyetracking and Quadrants

## In this version of the experiment, the code inherits from an exptools2 class that sets eyetracking settings. Further, gabor patches now appear randomly in one of four quadrants. Correct keys for each quadrant can be set in the settings file.
